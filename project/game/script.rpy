    "1968 HOLLYWOOD"

    "Kung-Fu movies are at its peak. Legend Bruce Lee is changing the movie industry by being a representation for the Asian community. "
    
    "Upcoming actor, Kyle Wang, is also making his mark."

    "Having been nominated for an academy award the year prior, his new project Time is Running Out, stars Kyle and his co-star, Daniella Tako, who was making her name known overseas in Japan. "

    "Hollywood producers and managers hesitated for months to make this project, questioning how many Americans would see an action packed film starring two Asians with a supporting cast of other well known Hollywood actors."
